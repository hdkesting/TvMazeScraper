From the bride and groom, to a family member, or even a jealous wedding guest - anyone could be the victim or suspect when marriage serves as the powerful catalyst for murder.</p>",

      "summary": "<p>Some of the world's most notorious murders are the subject of <b>It Takes a Killer</b> which investigates the crimes from the perspective of the killers, trying to get inside their minds and determine their motives. Leading homicide investigators and experts from such agencies as the FBI and Scotland Yard take a look at the evidence pulled from crime scenes and profile the killer's behavior to try to piece together the details of each murder, explaining when, why and how each criminal committed the crime. For the wannabe detectives watching the show, the experts also reveal how the crime was solved -- which often requires authorities to think like a killer.</p>",
