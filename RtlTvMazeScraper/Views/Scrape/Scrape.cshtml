<h2>Scrape by show id</h2>

<p>Pausing to scrape by show id starting from <em>@(((int)ViewBag.Start).ToString("N0"))</em></p>

<blockquote>
    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>
        Try and read a batch of shows by ID, starting from the number as specified in the "start" parameter.
        After each batch is read (and stored locally) there is a short pause before reading the next one to prevent overloading the remote system.
    </p>
    <p>The scraping will stop when several batches returned no results.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
    // client-side pause before scraping the next batch
    setTimeout(function () { location.href = "@Url.Action("Scrape", new { start = ViewBag.Start })" }, 7000);
</script>
